MIS Builder Analytic Distribution Filter
========================================

This module extends the functionality of mis_builder to
provide filtering on analytic distribution.

Configuration and Usage
=======================

In Accounting > Reporting > MIS Reports, there is a new field
'Analytic Distribution' which can be used to filter move lines on an
analytic distribution.

This filter is also available on the MIS Report widget, so the user
can change the filter in the preview and dashboard views.
