Create budgets for MIS reports.

This module lets you create budgets for any MIS report. Several budgets
can be created for a given report template (ie one budget per year). Budget
figures are provided at the KPI level, with different time periods. A budget
can then be selected as a data source for a MIS report column, and the report
will show the budgeted values for each KPI, adjusted for the period of the 
column.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you first need to flag at least some KPI in a MIS
report to be budgetable. You also need to configure the accumulation method
on the KPI according to their type. 

The accumulation method determines how budgeted values spanning over a
time period are transformed to match the reporting period.

* Sum: values of shorter period are added, values of longest or partially overlapping 
  periods are adjusted pro-rata temporis (eg monetary amount such as revenue).
* Average: values of included period are averaged with a pro-rata temporis weight.
  Typically used for values that do not accumulate over time (eg a number of employees).

When KPI are configured, you need to create a budget, then click on the budget items
button to create or import the budgeted amounts for all your KPI and time periods.

Finally, a column (aka period) must be added to a MIS report instance, selecting your
newly created budget as a data source. The data will be adjusted to the reporting period
when displayed. Columns can be compared by adding a column of type "comparison" or "sum".
