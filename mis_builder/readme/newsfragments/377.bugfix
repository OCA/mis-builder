Use the ``parent_state`` field of ``account.move.line`` to filter entries in ``posted``
and ``draft`` state only. Before, when reporting in draft mode, all entries were used
(i.e. there was no filter), and that started including the cancelled entries/invoices in
Odoo 13.+.

This change also contains a **breaking change** in the internal API. For quite a while
the ``target_move argument`` of AEP and other methods was not used by MIS Builder itself
and was kept for backward compatibility. To avoid rippling effects of the necessary
change to use ``parent_state``, we now remove this argument.
