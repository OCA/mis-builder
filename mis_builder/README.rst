This module allows you to build Management Information Systems dashboards.
Such style of reports presents KPI in rows and time periods in columns.
Reports mainly fetch data from account moves, but can also combine data coming
from arbitrary Odoo models. Reports can be exported to PDF, Excel and they
can be added to Odoo dashboards.

Installation
============

Your preferred way to install addons will work with MIS Builder.

An easy way to install it with all its dependencies is using pip:

* ``pip install --pre odoo11-addon-mis_builder``
* then restart Odoo, update the addons list in your database, and install
  the MIS Builder application.

Usage
=====

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Accounting > Configuration > MIS Reporting > MIS Report Templates where
  you can create report templates by defining KPI's. KPI's constitute the rows of your
  reports. Such report templates are time independent.

   :align: center

* Then in Accounting > Reports > MIS Reporting > MIS Reports you can create report instance by
  binding the templates to time periods, hence defining the columns of your reports.

Development
===========

A typical extension is to provide a mechanism to filter reports on analytic dimensions
or operational units. To implement this, you can override _get_additional_move_line_filter
and _get_additional_filter to further filter move lines or queries based on a user
selection. A typical use case could be to add an analytic account field on mis.report.instance,
or even on mis.report.instance.period if you want different columns to show different
analytic accounts.

Changelog
=========

11.0.3.6.3 (2020-08-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Having a "Compare columns" added on a KPI with an associated style using a
  Factor/Divider did lead to the said factor being applied on the percentages
  when exporting to XLSX. (`#300 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/300>`_)


**Misc**

- `#280 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/280>`_, `#296 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/296>`_


11.0.3.6.2 (2020-04-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- The "Settings" button is now displayed for users with the "Show full accounting features" right when previewing a report. (`#281 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/281>`_)


11.0.3.6.1 (2020-04-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fix ``TypeError: 'module' object is not iterable`` when using
  budgets by account. (`#276 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/276>`_)


11.0.3.6.0 (2020-03-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Add column-level filters on analytic account and analytic tags.
  These filters are combined with a AND with the report-level filters
  and cannot be modified in the preview. (`#138 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/138>`_)
- Access to KPI from other reports in KPI expressions, aka subreports. In a
  report template, one can list named "subreports" (other report templates). When
  evaluating expressions, you can access KPI's of subreports with a dot-prefix
  notation. Example: you can define a MIS Report for a "Balance Sheet", and then
  have another MIS Report "Balance Sheet Ratios" that fetches KPI's from "Balance
  Sheet" to create new KPI's for the ratios (e.g. balance_sheet.current_assets /
  balance_sheet.total_assets). (`#155 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/155>`_)


11.0.3.5.0 (2019-10-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- The ``account_id`` field of the model selected in 'Move lines source'
  in the Period form can now be a Many2one
  relationship with any model that has a ``code`` field (not only with
  ``account.account`` model). To this end, the model to be used for Actuals
  move lines can be configured on the report template. It can be something else
  than move lines and the only constraint is that its ``account_id`` field
  as a ``code`` field. (`#149 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/149>`_)
- Add ``source_aml_model_name`` field so extension modules providing
  alternative data sources can more easily customize their data source. (`#214 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/214>`_)
- Support analytic tag filters in the backend view and preview widget.
  Selecting several tags in the filter means filtering on move lines which
  have *all* these tags set. This is to support the most common use case of
  using tags for different dimensions. The filter also makes a AND with the
  analytic account filter. (`#228 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/228>`_)
- Display company in account details rows in multi-company mode. (`#242 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/242>`_)


**Bugfixes**

- Propagate context to xlsx report, so the analytic account filter
  works when exporting to xslx too. This also requires a fix to
  ``report_xlsx`` (see https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/pull/259). (`#178 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/178>`_)
- In columns of type Sum, preserve styles for KPIs that are not summable
  (eg percentage values). Before this fix, such cells were displayed without
  style. (`#219 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/219>`_)
- In Excel export, keep the percentage point suffix (pp) instead of replacing it with %. (`#220 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/220>`_)


11.0.3.4.0 (2019-07-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- New year-to-date mode for defining periods. (`#165 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/165>`_)
- Add support for move lines with negative debit or credit.
  Used by some for storno accounting. Not officially supported. (`#175 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/175>`_)
- In Excel export, use a number format with thousands separator. The
  specific separator used depends on the Excel configuration (eg regional
  settings). (`#190 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/190>`_)
- Add generation date/time at the end of the XLS export. (`#191 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/191>`_)
- In presence of Sub KPIs, report more informative user errors when
  non-multi expressions yield tuples of incorrect lenght. (`#196 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/196>`_)


**Bugfixes**

- Fix rendering of percentage types in Excel export. (`#192 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/192>`_)


11.0.3.3.0 (2019-01-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

*Dynamic analytic filters in report preview are not yet available in 11,
this requires an update to the JS widget that proved difficult to implement
so far. Help welcome.*

- Analytic account filters. On a report, an analytic
  account can be selected for filtering. The filter will
  be applied to move lines queries. A filter box is also
  available in the widget to let the user select the analytic
  account during report preview. (`#15 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/15>`_)
- Control visibility of analytic filter combo box in widget.
  This is useful to hide the analytic filters on reports where
  they do not make sense, such as balance sheet reports. (`#42 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/42>`_)
- Display analytic filters in the header of exported pdf and xls. (`#44 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/44>`_)
- Replace the last old gtk icons with fontawesome icons. (`#104 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/104>`_)
- Use active_test=False in AEP queries.
  This is important for reports involving inactive taxes.
  This should not negatively effect existing reports, because
  an accounting report must take into account all existing move lines
  even if they reference objects such as taxes, journals, accounts types
  that have been deactivated since their creation. (`#107 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/107>`_)
- int(), float() and round() support for AccountingNone. (`#108 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/108>`_)
- Allow referencing subkpis by name by writing `kpi_x.subkpi_y` in expressions. (`#114 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/114>`_)
- Add an option to control the display of the start/end dates in the
  column headers. It is disabled by default (this is a change compared
  to previous behaviour). (`#118 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/118>`_)
- Add evaluate method to mis.report. This is a simplified
  method to evaluate kpis of a report over a time period,
  without creating a mis.report.instance. (`#123 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/123>`_)

**Bugs**

- In the style form, hide the "Hide always" checkbox when "Hide always inherit"
  is checked, as for all other syle elements. (`#121 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/121>`_)

**Upgrading from 3.2 (breaking changes)**

If you use ``Actuals (alternative)`` data source in combination with analytic
filters, the underlying model must now have an ``analytic_account_id`` field.


11.0.3.2.2 (2018-06-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [FIX] Fix bug in company_default_get call returning
  id instead of recordset
  (`#103 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/103>`_)
* [IMP] add "hide always" style property to make hidden KPI's
  (for KPI that serve as basis for other formulas, but do not
  need to be displayed).
  (`#46 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/46>`_)

11.0.3.2.1 (2018-05-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [FIX] Missing comparison operator for AccountingNone
  leading to errors in pbal computations
  (`#93 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issue/93>`_)

10.0.3.2.0 (2018-05-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [FIX] make subkpi ordering deterministic
  (`#71 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/71>`_)
* [ADD] report instance level option to disable account expansion,
  enabling the creation of detailed templates while deferring the decision
  of rendering the details or not to the report instance
  (`#74 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/74>`_)
* [ADD] pbal and nbal accounting expressions, to sum positive
  and negative balances respectively (ie ignoring accounts with negative,
  resp positive balances)
  (`#86 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/86>`_)

11.0.3.1.2 (2018-02-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migration to Odoo 11. No new feature.
(`#67 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/67>`_)

10.0.3.1.1 (2017-11-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features:

* [ADD] month and year relative periods, easier to use than
  date ranges for the most common case.
  (`#2 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/2>`_)
* [ADD] multi-company consolidation support, with currency conversion
  (the conversion rate date is the end of the reporting period)
  (`#7 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/7>`_,
  `#3 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/3>`_)
* [ADD] provide ref, datetime, dateutil, time, user in the evaluation
  context of move line domains; among other things, this allows using
  references to xml ids (such as account types or tax tags) when
  querying move lines
  (`#26 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/26>`_).
* [ADD] extended account selectors: you can now select accounts using
  any domain on account.account, not only account codes
  ``balp[('user_type_id', '=', ref('account.data_account_type_receivable').id)]``
  (`#4 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/4>`_).
* [IMP] in the report instance configuration form, the filters are
  now grouped in a notebook page, this improves readability and
  extensibility
  (`#39 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/39>`_).

Bug fixes:

* [FIX] fix error when saving periods in comparison mode on newly
  created (not yet saved) report instances.
  `#50 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/50>`_
* [FIX] improve display of Base Date report instance view.
  `#51 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/51>`_

Upgrading from 3.0 (breaking changes):

* Alternative move line data sources must have a company_id field.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bug fix:

* [FIX] fix error saving KPI on newly created reports.
  `#18 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/18>`_

10.0.3.0.2 (2017-10-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features:

* [ADD] Alternative move line source per report column.
  This makes mis buidler accounting expressions work on any model
  that has debit, credit, account_id and date fields. Provided you can
  expose, say, committed purchases, or your budget as a view with
  debit, credit and account_id, this opens up a lot of possibilities
* [ADD] Comparison column source (more flexible than the previous,
  now deprecated, comparison mechanism).
  CAVEAT: there is no automated migration to the new mechanism.
* [ADD] Sum column source, to create columns that add/subtract
  other columns.
* [ADD] mis.kpi.data abstract model as a basis for manual KPI values
  supporting automatic ajustment to the reporting time period (the basis
  for budget item, but could also server other purposes, such as manually
  entering some KPI values, such as number of employee)
* [ADD] mis_builder_budget module providing a new budget data source
* [ADD] new "hide empty" style property
* [IMP] new AEP method to get accounts involved in an expression
  (this is useful to find which KPI relate to a given P&L
  acount, to implement budget control)
* [IMP] many UI improvements
* [IMP] many code style improvements and some refactoring
* [IMP] add the column date_from, date_to in expression evaluation context,
  as well as time, datetime and dateutil modules

Main bug fixes:

* [FIX] deletion of templates and reports (cascade and retricts)
  (https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/issues/281)
* [FIX] copy of reports
  (https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/issues/282)
* [FIX] better error message when periods have wrong/missing dates
  (https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/issues/283)
* [FIX] xlsx export of string types KPI
  (https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/issues/285)
* [FIX] sorting of detail by account
* [FIX] computation bug in detail by account when multiple accounting
  expressions were used in a KPI
* [FIX] permission issue when adding report to dashboard with non admin user

10.0.2.0.3 (unreleased)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [IMP] more robust behaviour in presence of missing expressions
* [FIX] indent style
* [FIX] local variable 'ctx' referenced before assignment when generating
  reports with no objects
* [IMP] use fontawesome icons

9.0.2.0.2 (2016-09-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [IMP] Add refresh button in mis report preview.
* [IMP] Widget code changes to allow to add fields in the widget more easily.

9.0.2.0.1 (2016-05-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [IMP] remove unused argument in declare_and_compute_period()
  for a cleaner API. This is a breaking API changing merged in
  urgency before it is used by other modules.

9.0.2.0.0 (2016-05-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of the work for this release has been done at the Sorrento sprint
April 26-29, 2016. The rest (ie a major refactoring) has been done in
the weeks after.

* [IMP] hide button box in edit mode on the report instance settings form
* [FIX] Fix sum aggregation of non-stored fields
  (https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/issues/178)
* [IMP] There is now a default style at the report level
* [CHG] Number display properties (rounding, prefix, suffix, factor) are
  now defined in styles
* [CHG] Percentage difference are rounded to 1 digit instead of the kpi's
  rounding, as the KPI rounding does not make sense in this case
* [CHG] The divider suffix (k, M, etc) is not inserted automatically anymore
  because it is inconsistent when working with prefixes; you need to add it
  manually in the suffix
* [IMP] AccountingExpressionProcessor now supports 'balu' expressions
  to obtain the unallocated profit/loss of previous fiscal years;
  get_unallocated_pl is the corresponding convenience method
* [IMP] AccountingExpressionProcessor now has easy methods to obtain
  balances by account: get_balances_initial, get_balances_end,
  get_balances_variation
* [IMP] there is now an auto-expand feature to automatically display
  a detail by account for selected kpis
* [IMP] the kpi and period lists are now manipulated through forms instead
  of directly in the tree views
* [IMP] it is now possible to create a report through a wizard, such
  reports are deemed temporary and available through a "Last Reports Generated"
  menu, they are garbaged collected automatically, unless saved permanently,
  which can be done using a Save button
* [IMP] there is now a beginner mode to configure simple reports with
  only one period
* [IMP] it is now easier to configure periods with fixed start/end dates
* [IMP] the new sub-kpi mechanism allows the creation of columns
  with multiple values, or columns with different values
* [IMP] thanks to the new style model, the Excel export is now styled
* [IMP] a new style model is now used to centralize style configuration
* [FIX] use =like instead of like to search for accounts, because
  the % are added by the user in the expressions
* [FIX] Correctly compute the initial balance of income and expense account
  based on the start of the fiscal year
* [IMP] Support date ranges (from OCA/server-tools/date_range) as a more
  flexible alternative to fiscal periods
* v9 migration: fiscal periods are removed, account charts are removed,
  consolidation accounts have been removed

8.0.1.0.0 (2016-04-27)

* The copy of a MIS Report Instance now copies period.
  https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/pull/181
* The copy of a MIS Report Template now copies KPIs and queries.
  https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/pull/177
