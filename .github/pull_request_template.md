Thanks for your pull request. Please take a moment to review if it meets the following guidelines.

## Description

Before coding, it is recommended to create an issue to discuss the problem or feature you want to add.
If you did not, don't worry, we can discuss on the PR too.

If there is a pre-existing issue that your PR implements or fixes,
add a pointer to it in the PR description.

If your PR is simple enough that it does not require a preliminary discussion, then
make sure to explain what it does (i.e. *why* the change is necessary).

## Test

Don't forget to add unit tests. If your PR fixes a bug, prefer creating a separate commit for the test
so we one see that your test reproduces the bug and is fixed by the PR.

## Target branch

MIS Builder is actively maintained for Odoo versions 9, 10, 11 and 12.

If your feature is applicable with the same implementation to all these versions,
please target branch 10.0. Maintainers will port it to 9, 11 and 12 soon after merging.

In the rare cases your feature or implementation is specific to an Odoo version,
then target the corresponding branch.

`.doc` (for documentation improvements), `.misc` (if a ticket has been closed,
but it is not of interest to users). The changelog entry must be reasonably short
and phrased in a way that is understandable by end users.
