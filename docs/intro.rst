Introduction
============

MIS Builder is an Odoo module that implements a class of Odoo reports where KPI
(Key Performance Indicators) are displayed in rows, and time periods in columns.
It focuses on very fast reporting on accounting data but can also use data from
any other Odoo model.

It features the following key characteristics:

- User-friendly configuration: end users can create new report templates without
  development, sing simple Excel-like formulas.
- Very fast balance reporting for accounting data, even on million-line databases
  with very complex account charts.
- Reusability: Use the same template for different reports.
- Multi-period comparisons: Compare data over different time periods.
- User-configurable styles: perfectly rendered in the UI as well as in Excel and
  PDF exports.
- Interactive display with drill-down.
- WYSIWYG Export to PDF and Excel.
- A budgeting module.
- KPI Evaluation over various data sources, such as actuals, simulation, committed
  costs (custom developments are required to create the data source).
- Easy-to-use API for developers for the accounting balance computation engine.
